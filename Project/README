I modified the conf.py a little bit.
(1) I use my own API key:


(2) The server names in conf.py downloaded from CCLE are all in uppercase.
However, on the spec, a valid server name should contain only one uppercase
letter and this letter should be at the beginning of the server name.
For example, "Alford" is valid, but "ALFORD" is not.

Therefore, I change:
ALFORD to Alford
BALL to Ball
HAMILTON to Hamilton
HOLIDAY to Holiday
WELSH to Welsh

(3) I use the port numbers that are assigned to me:
12088 <= PORT <= 12095
Alford: 12090
Ball: 12091
Hamilton: 12092
Holiday: 12093
Welsh: 12094
